A simplified version of the International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is a symmetric-key block cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data using a 128-bit key. 
It's known for its strength and efficiency and was initially designed as a potential replacement for DES (Data Encryption Standard).
